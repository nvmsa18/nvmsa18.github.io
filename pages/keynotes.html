    Onur Mutlu is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. He is
    also a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University, where he
    previously held the William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Early Career
    Professorship. His current broader research interests are in computer
    architecture, systems, and bioinformatics. He is especially interested
    in interactions across domains and between applications, system
    software, compilers, and microarchitecture, with a major current focus
    on memory and storage systems. A variety of techniques he and his
    group have invented over the years have influenced industry and have
    been employed in commercial microprocessors and memory/storage
    systems. He obtained his PhD and MS in ECE from the University of
    Texas at Austin and BS degrees in Computer Engineering and Psychology
    from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His industrial experience
    spans starting the Computer Architecture Group at Microsoft Research
    (2006-2009), and various product and research positions at Intel
    Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, VMware, and Google.  He received
    the inaugural IEEE Computer Society Young Computer Architect Award,
    the inaugural Intel Early Career Faculty Award, faculty partnership
    awards from various companies, a healthy number of best paper or "Top
    Pick" paper recognitions at various computer systems and architecture
    venues, and the ACM Fellow recognition.  His computer architecture
    course lectures and materials are freely available on YouTube, and his
    research group makes software artifacts freely available online. For

    Onur Mutlu is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. He is also an Adjunct Professor 
    of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, where he held the 
    Dr. William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Early Career Professorship.

    His research is in computer architecture, systems, and bioinformatics. His work spans and 
    stretches the boundaries between applications, systems, languages, system software, 
    compilers, and hardware. His research tackles many issues in high performance, 
    energy efficiency, hardware security, fault tolerance, predictable systems, 
    dependable systems, and hardware/software cooperation. He is especially excited about 
    novel computation, communication and memory/storage paradigms, applied to emerging systems, 
    technologies, and bioinformatics/medical applications.     
    He has published over 200 journal/conference papers in those areas, which are cited more than 
    16K times as of Dec. 2017. Also, he has recieved over 40 honors/awards including Hall of Fame in the ISCA/MICRO/HPCA.
