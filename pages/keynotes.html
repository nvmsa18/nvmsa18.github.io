Onur Mutlu is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. He is
also a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University, where he
previously held the William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Early Career
Professorship. His current broader research interests are in computer
architecture, hardware security, computing systems, and
bioinformatics. He is especially interested in interactions across
domains and between applications, system software, compilers, and
microarchitecture, with a major current focus on memory and storage
systems. A variety of techniques he, along with his group and
collaborators, have invented over the years have influenced industry
and have been employed in commercial microprocessors and
memory/storage systems. He obtained his PhD and MS in ECE from the
University of Texas at Austin and BS degrees in Computer Engineering
and Psychology from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His
industrial experience spans starting the Computer Architecture Group
at Microsoft Research (2006-2009), and various product and research
positions at Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, VMware, and
Google.  He received the inaugural IEEE Computer Society Young
Computer Architect Award, the inaugural Intel Early Career Faculty
Award, faculty partnership awards from various companies, a healthy
number of best paper or "Top Pick" paper recognitions at various
computer systems and architecture venues, and the ACM Fellow
recognition "for contributions to computer architecture research,
especially in memory systems."  His computer architecture course
lectures and materials are freely available on YouTube, and his
research group makes software artifacts freely available online. For

    of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, where he held the 
    Dr. William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Early Career Professorship.

    His research is in computer architecture, systems, and bioinformatics. His work spans and 
    stretches the boundaries between applications, systems, languages, system software, 
    compilers, and hardware. His research tackles many issues in high performance, 
    energy efficiency, hardware security, fault tolerance, predictable systems, 
    dependable systems, and hardware/software cooperation. He is especially excited about 
    novel computation, communication and memory/storage paradigms, applied to emerging systems, 
    technologies, and bioinformatics/medical applications.     
    He has published over 200 journal/conference papers in those areas, which are cited more than 
    16K times as of Dec. 2017. Also, he has recieved over 40 honors/awards including Hall of Fame in the ISCA/MICRO/HPCA.

    <h2 id=tokuda>Keynote by Prof. Hideyuki Tokuda [Main Conference Room] (11:00-12:00, Aug. 30)</h2>

    <h3>Title: <font color="black">Shaping the Future Society by IoT and AI ~ Evolution of ICT and its "light" and "shadow" ~</font>
</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
    <p style="font-size:15px">
The evolution of IoT (Internet of Things) and AI is accelerating. Smart devices, sensors, and actuators create smart IoT devices and connected services in transportation, manufacturing, energy, environment, disaster prevention/mitigation, safety, healthcare and so on.  In addition, various digital optimization and automation are deployed by visualization and analysis of big data collected by IoT. Many predictive apps are also initiated by AI. 
<br><br>
While we are expanding these "connected merits", cyberattacks targeting familiar IoT devices are also rapidly increasing, and the "connected risks" are diversifying. Furthermore, the ethical, legal and social implications by introducing AI are concerned.
<br><br>
In this talk, we first introduce the research and development activities of NICT and various IoT and AI services in use.  We then discuss the current status of cyberattacks targeting IoT devices and the capacity building of Cybersecurity specialists in Japan.  We summarize with the issues in shaping future society with IoT and AI.
